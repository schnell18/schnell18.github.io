      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Feng Zhang a.k.a Justin is an experienced software engineer and tech lead with
a strong track record in building high-availability cloud-native
micro-services. At UCloud, I led the development and operation of a managed
Kubernetes service (UK8S) serving hundreds of customers as well as designed and
implemented a data platform integrating MySQL, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs to
enable cost analysis and revenue insights. At Ping An Good Doctor, I developed
a high-performance BFF system handling 20M+ daily requests with sub-100ms
latency, complemented by custom observability using Grafana and InfluxDB. My
master research at AUT focused on LLM quantization, making AI runs faster with
less resource consumption.
