## Overview

Profiling golang program enables us to gain insights of the inner workings of
golang application and allows us identify performance bottle-neck. The built-in
golang tool pprof supports three types of profiling: CPU, Memory, and Trace.
CPU profiling reveals the time consumed across various code paths, making
identifying performance hotspots easier. Memory profiling provides information
on memory allocation patterns. While trace profiling offers a complete and
dynamic view of statistics of CPU, memory, goroutines over the life-cycle of
the program being profiled.

Applying the three profiling tools follows a general procedure which consists
of following major steps:

1. Instrument the main function
2. Build instrumented program
3. Run instrumented executable
4. Analyse and visualising profiling results

However, manually applying this procedure is error-prone, this blog proposes a
structured approach to conduct CPU/Memory/Trace profilings for any golang
project, using the [go-pprof-example][2] (program that generates complex
Mandelbrot fractal) as an example, which demonstrates how to insert profiling
code, execute instrumented program, and visualise profiling results with a
Makefile that orchestrates and automates the profiling tasks. This approach can
be generalized and adapted to golang projects with varying complexity.

## CPU profiling

Profiling CPU usage of a golang program requires instrumentation of the main
function like:

~~~go
// at the start of main.go, import this library
import "github.com/pkg/profile"

//...
func main() {
	defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()

    // ...
}
~~~

The `Makefile` the of [go-pprof-example][2] project includes a target named
*prep-pprof-cpu* to automate the instrumentation of profiling code and build
the corresponding binary. This target instruments the main function using a
Perl one-liner and the goimports CLI. The second target *pprof-cpu* launches
the instrumented program and collect profiling data. Additionally, the third
target *pprof-viz-cpu* launches a webserver and browser to display various
tables and diagrams. This target chains the previous two targets, therefore you
can invoke it to automate the entire CPU profiling process in one go like:

~~~bash
make pprof-viz-cpu
~~~

When the above command completes, you should see the callgraph being displayed
in the browser like:

## Memory profiling

Similar to CPU profiling, getting insights of memory usage of a golang program
also needs instrumentation of the main function:

~~~go
// at the start of main.go, import this library
import "github.com/pkg/profile"

//...
func main() {
	defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()

    // ...
}
~~~

The `Makefile` of the [go-pprof-example][2] project also includes a target
named *prep-pprof-mem* to automate the instrumentation. You can experiment the
entire memory profiling process in one go like:

~~~bash
make pprof-viz-mem
~~~

When this command finishes, you should see the memory graph being displayed
in the browser like:

![Mandelbrot Memory visuals](images/mandelbrot-mem-pprof.png)

## Trace profiling

Similar to CPU and Memory profiling, the generating trace of a golang program
is also mandatory to instrument the main function as follows:

~~~go
// at the start of main.go, import this library
import "github.com/pkg/profile"

//...
func main() {
	defer profile.Start(profile.TraceProfile, profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()

    // ...
}
~~~
The `Makefile` of the [go-pprof-example][2] project also includes a target
named *prep-pprof-trace* to automate the instrumentation. You can experiment the
entire trace profiling process in one go like:

~~~bash
make pprof-viz-trace
~~~

When the previous command succeeds, you should see the trace being displayed
in the browser like:

## Conclusion

By encoding the knowledge of instrumentation, executing profiling and launching
go pprof tool for visualisation and analysis in Makefile, we can share the
skills to gain insights of golang application internals in a scalable and
consistent way. The [go-pprof-example][2] project is a good starting point to
automate golang profiling tasks on real-world projects.

## Reference

The mandelbrot example is inspired by the presentation [GopherCon 2019: Two Go
Programs, Three Different Profiling Techniques - Dave Cheney][1]. For complete
information on how to use the web interface, please refer to [the official
document of go pprof tool][3].
