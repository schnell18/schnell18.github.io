## Introduction

Creating a personal website has never been more accessible or affordable. This comprehensive guide will walk you through building a professional website using Hugo, GitHub Pages, and Namecheapâ€”a cost-effective combination that delivers excellent performance with annual cost as low as two dollars.

## Why This Technology Stack?

### Hugo: The Static Site Generator Champion

Hugo stands out among static site generators for several compelling reasons:

- **Lightning-fast generation**: Hugo can build thousands of pages in seconds, making it ideal for both small personal sites and large content-heavy websites
- **Abundant themes**: The Hugo community has created hundreds of beautiful, responsive themes available at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io)
- **Responsive design**: Most Hugo themes are mobile-first, ensuring your site looks great on PC, tablet, and phone
- **SEO-friendly**: Hugo generates clean HTML with proper semantic structure, making it easy for search engines to index your content
- **No database required**: Static sites are inherently more secure and faster than dynamic alternatives

### GitHub Pages: Free, Reliable Hosting

GitHub Pages offers compelling advantages for personal websites:

- **Free hosting**: No monthly fees for public repositories
- **Automatic deployments**: Push to your repository and your site updates automatically
- **Custom domain support**: Use your own domain name for free
- **99.9% uptime**: Backed by GitHub's robust infrastructure
- **Global CDN**: Content delivery network ensures fast loading worldwide

### Namecheap: Affordable Domain Registration

Namecheap provides excellent value for domain registration:

- **Competitive pricing**: Often significantly cheaper than competitors
- **Free privacy protection**: Included with most domains to protect your personal information
- **User-friendly interface**: Easy-to-use control panel for DNS management
- **Reliable customer support**: 24/7 support when you need assistance

Since domain registration is the only source of cost in our solution, to keep
the overall cost low we have to trade-off the choice of TLD. The table below
presents the price for various TLD on Namecheap.

| TLD | Annual Cost (Namecheap) | Renewal Cost | Best For | Considerations |
|-----|------------------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| .com | $8.88 | $12.98 | Personal/Business | Most trusted, universal recognition |
|.xyz | $1.98 | $11.98 |Budget-conscious | Very affordable first year, mixed reputation|
| .net | $10.98 | $14.98 | Tech professionals | Good alternative to .com |
| .org | $10.98 | $14.98 | Non-profits/Personal | Implies organization/community |
| .io | $35.88 | $54.88 | Tech/Startups | Trendy but expensive |
| .me | $18.88 | $19.98 | Personal branding | Perfect for personal sites |
| .dev | $12.98 | $17.98 | Developers | Google-owned, requires HTTPS |
| .tech | $48.88 | $54.88 | Technology sites | Descriptive but costly |
| .blog | $29.98 | $32.98 | Bloggers | Clear purpose, moderate cost |

3. **Add the following DNS records**:

#### A Records (IPv4)
Point your domain to GitHub Pages IPv4 addresses:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 185.199.108.153 | Automatic |
| A | @ | 185.199.109.153 | Automatic |

**Important for New Zealand users**: DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours in New Zealand due to the geographic distance from major DNS servers and internet infrastructure hubs. Be patient and use tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) to check propagation status.

### Step 2: Hugo Installation and Setup

1. **Install Hugo** following the official guide at [gohugo.io/installation](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

2. **Create a new Hugo site**:
```bash
hugo new site my-website
cd my-website
```

3. **Choose a theme** from [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io) and install it:
```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theme-author/theme-name.git themes/theme-name
```

4. **Configure your site** by editing `config.toml`:
```toml
baseURL = "https://yourdomain.com"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Your Site Title"
theme = "theme-name"
```

### Step 3: GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create a repository** named `yourusername.github.io` on GitHub
2. **Add your Hugo site** to the repository
3. **Create a GitHub Action** for automatic deployment by adding `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

### Step 4: Google Search Console Setup

1. **Visit** [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
2. **Add your property** using your domain name
3. **Verify domain ownership** by adding a TXT record to your DNS:

```
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: google-site-verification=your-google-verification-code
TTL: Automatic
```

4. **Submit your sitemap** at `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
5. **Monitor** your site's search performance and indexing status

## Privacy and Content Guidelines

### Protecting Your Privacy

When adding personal photos to your website:

1. **Remove EXIF data** before uploading images. EXIF data can contain:
   - GPS coordinates (exact location where photo was taken)
   - Camera model and settings
   - Date and time stamps
   - Device information

2. **Use EXIF removal tools**:
   - **Desktop**: GIMP, Photoshop, or dedicated EXIF tools
   - **Command line 1**: `magick image.jpg -strip image.jpg`
   - **Command line 2**: `exiftool -all= image.jpg`

3. **Be mindful of background details** in photos that might reveal your location

### Image Attribution and Copyright

Always respect copyright and give proper attribution:

1. **Use royalty-free sources**:
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) - Free high-quality photos
   - [Pexels](https://pexels.com) - Free stock photos and videos
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) - Free images, videos, and music

2. **Create an attribution section** in your site footer or dedicated page.
3. **Follow CC license requirements** for Creative Commons images
4. **Keep records** of image sources and licenses

### DNS Considerations for New Zealand Users

Due to New Zealand's geographic isolation from major internet infrastructure:

- **DNS propagation** typically takes 24-48 hours (vs 2-24 hours elsewhere)
- **Use local DNS servers** like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 for faster resolution
- **Test from multiple locations** using tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
- **Consider CloudFlare** for additional CDN benefits if your site grows
